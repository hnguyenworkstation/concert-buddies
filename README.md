# Concert Buddies

## Proposal
Concert Buddies is an android application that pairs up strangers who are going to the same concert. Users can pick an event and quickly browse the other attendee profiles. If two users "like" each other, they are put into a chat to arrange their meetup.


## Architecture

Concert Buddies uses following approach/libraries:

- [Java] as main programming language
- [Butter Kife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) for views/functions binding
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for Image caching and loading
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) for Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc.
- [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) for serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back
- [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus) for simplifing communication between Activities, Fragments, Threads, Services, etc. 
- [Parceler](https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler) for sending objects to child activities/fragments
